# Strudel Workshop Notebook

An interactive, **fully offline** web notebook for teaching live-coding music with Strudel.
Each cell holds editable code that plays sound directly in the browser — no internet, no
accounts, no CDN.

---

## Prerequisites

1. **Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) 18 or newer.** It's the only runtime you need —
   everything below runs on Node builtins with no other dependencies.
2. **Install [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)** and clone this repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/synacktraa/strudel-demo-and-player.git
   cd strudel-demo-and-player
   ```

## The two commands

```bash
npm run setup
```

Downloads Strudel and its whole sample library into `app/vendor/`, then rewrites Strudel's
internal URLs to point there. **Needs internet — run it before you leave.** Takes roughly
20–30 minutes and about 215 MB. If it's interrupted, run it again: completed files are kept
and skipped.

```bash
npm run app
```

Starts the notebook and opens it in your browser. **Runs with no internet at all.** It
prints the URL too, and picks another port automatically if 8000 is taken.

That's the whole workflow.

### Offline is the default, deliberately

There is also an online mode:

```bash
npm run app:online
```

It loads Strudel, React and every sample from the CDN, needs no `npm run setup`, and
unlocks the sets too large to vendor — the full VCSL orchestral library, mridangam, and
helpers like `samples('github:...')` and `shabda(...)`. Useful for developing on a machine
that hasn't run setup, or for trying something the vendored library doesn't cover.

**Offline stays the default because the failure modes are not symmetric.** Defaulting to
offline on a machine that happens to have internet costs nothing — it just uses local files.
Defaulting to online on a machine that doesn't costs you the workshop. A flag you have to
remember is a flag that gets forgotten exactly once, at the worst possible moment.

For the same reason there is **no automatic fallback** from offline to CDN. A machine with
half-finished assets would look fine during prep on your wifi and die in the classroom.
`npm run app` refuses to start and tells you to run setup instead.

Only the third-party libraries move in online mode; `ui/` and `styles.css` are always
served from disk, so what you develop is what ships.

---

## Checking a machine is ready

```bash
npm run verify
```

Runs offline in about a second and prints a per-item report:

```
  [ ok ] vendor manifest                profile "recommended", strudel 1.3.0
  [ ok ] strudel bundle                 2.1 MB
  [ ok ] no remote asset URLs in bundle 5 base URLs redirected to /vendor/
  [ ok ] audio worklet                  1 present
  [ ok ] sample maps                    7 present
  [ ok ] sample audio                   709 bank(s) spot-checked, all present
  [ ok ] soundfonts                     126 GM font file(s)
  [ ok ] last setup run                 clean
  [ ok ] index.html sub-resources       all local
```

It exits non-zero if anything is missing, so you can loop it over a room of machines.
`npm run app` does its own quick check on startup and tells you to run setup if assets
are missing.

### Setting up many machines

Nothing in `app/vendor/` is machine-specific. Run `npm run setup` once, then copy the whole
project folder to the other machines — far faster than 25 minutes each. Every machine still
needs Node.js installed.

## Layout

```
app/                  everything that gets served — runs offline
  index.html          shell: one <div id="root"> and the local script tags
  styles.css
  server.mjs          static server, Node builtins only
  ui/                 the React app (no build step — see below)
    main.js           mounts <Notebook> into #root
    Notebook.js       header, nav, sections, panic button
    StrudelCell.js    one cell + the imperatively mounted <strudel-editor>
    Equalizer.js      canvas visualiser driven by the master audio tap
    useMasterAnalyser.js
    lessons.js        all lesson content, as data
    Icon.js  runtime.js
  vendor/             downloaded assets (gitignored — a build output, not source)

setup/        everything that needs internet — never runs at the workshop
  index.mjs   entry point for `npm run setup`
  vendor.mjs  downloads and rewrites the assets
  verify.mjs  the offline readiness report
  lib/

tests/
  unit/       fast, no dependencies
  e2e/        Playwright, with the internet blocked
```

A server is required rather than opening `index.html` directly: Strudel's AudioWorklet,
SharedWorker and sample loading are all blocked on `file://` URLs.

## What "offline" actually means here

The original notebook loaded five things over the network. All of them are now local:

| Was | Now |
|---|---|
| `unpkg.com/@strudel/repl@1` | `app/vendor/strudel/index.js` |
| `kit.fontawesome.com` icon kit | inline `<svg>` sprite in `index.html` |
| `raw.githubusercontent.com` sample maps + audio | `app/vendor/samples/` |
| `felixroos.github.io` GM soundfonts | `app/vendor/soundfonts/` |
| `unpkg.com/hydra-synth` | `app/vendor/hydra/` |

Verified in a real browser with all non-localhost traffic blocked: the page loads, every
cell plays, and **zero requests leave the machine**.

### What's included

- **All 16 default drum sounds** (`bd sd hh oh cp rim mt lt ht cr rd cb sh tb brk misc`)
- **All 683 drum-machine banks** — TR-808, TR-909, LinnDrum, and the rest, via `.bank()`
- **Dirt-Samples** (`casio crow insect wind jazz metal east space numbers`)
- **Sampled piano** (29 notes)
- **125 General MIDI instruments** (`gm_piano`, `gm_acoustic_bass`, `gm_epiano1`, …)
- All built-in synths (`sawtooth`, `triangle`, `sine`, `square`) — these need no samples

### What's not

- **VCSL orchestral library** (~2 GB) and **mridangam** (~39 MB) are skipped by default.
- `samples('github:...')` and `shabda(...)` fetch from the internet by design and will fail
  offline. Nothing in the notebook uses them.

To include more:

```bash
npm run setup -- --profile=generous
```

| Profile | Size | Contents |
|---|---|---|
| `lean` | ~25 MB | default kit, Dirt-Samples, piano, 20 drum machines, only the GM instruments the notebook names |
| `recommended` *(default)* | ~215 MB | everything above plus all 683 drum machines and one variant of all 125 GM instruments |
| `generous` | ~400 MB | adds mridangam and 3 variants per GM instrument |
| `full` | ~2.3 GB | adds the complete VCSL orchestral library |

## Language

The notebook is **bilingual: Indonesian and English shown together**, Indonesian leading and
English beneath it in smaller type.

Not a language switcher, deliberately. The students read Indonesian and the teaching team
does not; the teachers read English and the students may not. A switcher means whoever is
not holding the mouse cannot read the screen — including a teacher leaning over a student's
shoulder to help. Showing both costs a little vertical space and solves that outright.

The **ID + EN / ID / EN** control in the header narrows the display when you want it (handy
on a projector). It is remembered per machine, and defaults to showing both.

> ⚠️ **The Indonesian has not been checked by a native speaker.** It was written by whoever
> generated this code, not by anyone on the teaching team. **Please have a local reviewer
> read it before teaching from it** — a mistranslated instruction is worse than none.
>
> Everything is in two files, each string beside its English pair:
> - `app/ui/lessons.js` — all lesson content
> - `app/ui/text.js` — buttons, tooltips, the header tagline
>
> The format is `t('Indonesian', 'English')`. Edit the first string only.
> `npm test` fails if any string is missing a language, or if the code samples inside a
> lesson differ between the two.

## Using it in the workshop

- Project the page and walk through the cells in order.
- Each cell has its own **Play** button; cells layer, so you can run several at once.
- **Ctrl+Enter** plays the focused cell, **Ctrl+.** stops it.
- **Stop All Sounds** in the header is the panic button.
- Students edit the code in place and press Play again to hear the change.

**The six lesson cells ship empty on purpose** — the plan is to write them live in front of
the class. Only the demo cell at the top is pre-filled, as a "here's where this goes"
showcase.

Each cell has a **Hint** button showing the pattern below, so you don't have to remember
them. They are the same strings listed here — `tests/unit/hints.test.mjs` fails if the two
drift apart.

**1 · Rhythm**

```js
s("bd hh sd hh")
```

**2 · Repetition**

```js
s("bd*2 hh*4 sd hh*2")
```

**3 · Melody**

```js
note("c e g e a g e c")
```

**4 · Instruments**

```js
note("c e g b").sound("sawtooth")
```

**5 · Layering**

```js
stack(
  s("bd*2 hh*4 sd hh*2"),
  note("c e g e").sound("sawtooth")
)
```

**6 · Effects**

```js
note("c e g b a g e c")
  .sound("sawtooth")
  .room(0.6)
  .delay(0.4)
```

Every sound named above is vendored, so all of it works offline.

## Troubleshooting

**"The offline assets are missing"** — `npm run setup` hasn't finished on this machine. Run
it somewhere with internet, or copy `app/vendor/` from a machine that has it.

**No sound at all** — browsers block audio until you interact with the page. Click any Play
button first. If it's still silent, check the system volume and output device.

**A cell says "sound not found"** — that bank wasn't vendored. Run `npm run verify` to see
what's present, or re-run setup with `--profile=generous`.

**Setup failed partway** — run it again. Completed files are kept and skipped.

**Want a specific port** — `node app/server.mjs --port=9000`.

---

## The UI

The notebook is a React app with **no build step**. React, ReactDOM and htm are vendored as
UMD bundles into `app/vendor/ui-libs/` and loaded as plain script tags; `htm` provides
JSX-like syntax through tagged templates, so components read normally without a compiler.
That matters because the workshop machines have no internet and no `node_modules` — there
is nothing to install and nothing to compile, the browser just runs the files.

React 18 rather than 19, because 19 dropped the UMD builds.

One deliberate exception to React owning the DOM: `<strudel-editor>` is created imperatively
and mounted exactly once per cell. It holds a scheduler, a prebaked sample registry and an
AudioWorklet, and it inserts its own CodeMirror container as a sibling of itself — so a
React remount would cut the audio and re-run a multi-second prebake. Each editor lives in a
host `<div>` that React renders empty and never reconciles into.

The header equalizer reads Strudel's master output (superdough's `destinationGain`) through
an `AnalyserNode`, so it responds to every cell without students adding `.analyze()` to
their own patterns.

## How it works

`setup/vendor.mjs` reads `app/index.html` to find which soundfonts and banks the lessons
actually use, so the demo cell's `gm_epiano1:1` pulls the second variant, not just the
first. `setup/lib/rewrite.mjs` patches the Strudel bundle's five hardcoded remote base
URLs and **throws if any expected URL is missing** — a future Strudel release that moves
its URLs fails loudly at setup rather than silently phoning home at the workshop.

## Development

```bash
npm test          # unit tests, no dependencies, ~1s
npm run test:e2e  # Playwright: loads the page with the internet blocked
npm run test:all
npm run test:online  # opt-in, needs internet: checks --online mode still works
```

The E2E suite hard-aborts every non-localhost request, so a regression that reintroduces a
CDN can't pass by succeeding on a machine that happens to be online. Playwright is a
devDependency for the prep machine only — the notebook itself never needs it.
